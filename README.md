## Tech stack:
1) HTML => Used to give page the structure. For example to have a list or the form that is at the top.

2) CSS => Used to style the page, not that much styling on this project, most of css was used for positioning

3) Javascript => Used to manipulate DOM and communicate with server

4) External GitHub API => Used to get data to display on screen on submission and also on clicking a user in the initial list

## AS a user:

1) You will need to enter a username to being with
2) on submision you will see a list of users with each list item having 3 pieces of information specific to each user. PLEASE BE PATIENT IT MAY TAKE A COUPLE OF SECONDS
Note: The 3 pices of informaion are:
   - the username
   - the user's avatar
   - a link to the user's GitHub page
3) to get information on a given user's repositories click the username of the user you are intrested in.
4) Look at the user's repos on the right side of your screen.
